	abstract = {This paper presents a time-lapse application of electrical methods (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT; and mise-{\`a}-la-masse, MALM) for monitoring plant roots and their activity (root water uptake) during a controlled infiltration experiment. The use of non-invasive geophysical monitoring is of increasing interest as these techniques provide time-lapse imaging of processes that otherwise can only be measured at few specific spatial locations. The experiment here described was conducted in a vineyard in Bordeaux (France) and was focused on the behaviour of two neighbouring grapevines. The joint application of ERT and MALM has several advantages. While ERT in time-lapse mode is sensitive to changes in soil electrical resistivity and thus to the factors controlling it (mainly soil water content, in this context), MALM uses DC current injected into a tree stem to image where the plant root system is in effective electrical contact with the soil at locations that are likely to be the same where root water uptake (RWU) takes place. Thus, ERT and MALM provide complementary information about the root structure and activity. The experiment shows that the region of likely electrical current sources produced by MALM does not change significantly during the infiltration time in spite of the strong changes of electrical resistivity caused by changes in soil water content. Ultimately, the interpretation of the current source distribution strengthened the hypothesis of using current as a proxy for root detection. This fact, together with the evidence that current injection in the soil and in the stem produces totally different voltage patterns, corroborates the idea that this application of MALM highlights the active root density in the soil. When considering the electrical resistivity changes (as measured by ERT) inside the stationary volume of active roots delineated by MALM, the overall tendency is towards a resistivity increase during irrigation time, which can be linked to a decrease in soil water content caused by root water uptake. On the contrary, when considering the soil volume outside the MALM-derived root water uptake region, the electrical resistivity tends to decrease as an effect of soil water content increase caused by the infiltration. The use of a simplified infiltration model confirms at least qualitatively this behaviour. The monitoring results are particularly promising, and the method can be applied to a variety of scales including the laboratory scale where direct evidence of root structure and root water uptake can help corroborate the approach. Once fully validated, the joint use of MALM and ERT can be used as a valuable tool to study the activity of roots under a wide variety of field conditions.},

	abstract = {The work in this paper is motivated by the increasing use of electrical and electromagnetic methods in geoscience problems where steel-cased wells are present. Applications of interest include monitoring carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. Also of interest is detecting flaws or breaks in degrading steel-casings---such wells pose serious environmental hazards. The general principles of electrical methods with steel-cased wells are understood and several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel-cased wells can be beneficial for detecting signal due to targets at depth. However, the success of a direct current (DC) resistivity survey lies in the details. Secondary signals might only be a few per cent of the primary signal. In designing a survey, the geometry of the source and receivers, and whether the source is at the top of the casing, inside of it, or beneath the casing will impact measured responses. Also the physical properties and geometry of the background geology, target and casing will have a large impact on the measured data. Because of the small values of the diagnostic signals, it is important to understand the detailed physics of the problem and also to be able to carry out accurate simulations. This latter task is computationally challenging because of the extreme geometry of the wells, which extend kilometers in depth but have millimeter variations in the radial direction, and the extreme variation in the electrical conductivity which is typically 5--7 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background geology.},

The approach is very expensive and is clearly not applicable in existing sites, where retrofitting is not an option.

	abstract = {Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and induced polarization (IP) methods are now widely used in many interdisciplinary projects. Although field surveys using these methods are relatively straightforward, ERT and IP data require the application of inverse methods prior to any interpretation. Several established non-commercial inversion codes exist, but they typically require advanced knowledge to use effectively. ResIPy was developed to provide a more intuitive, user-friendly, approach to inversion of geoelectrical data, using an open source graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python application programming interface (API). ResIPy utilizes the mature R2/cR2 inversion codes for ERT and IP, respectively. The ResIPy GUI facilitates data importing, data filtering, error modeling, mesh generation, data inversion and plotting of inverse models. Furthermore, the easy to use design of ResIPy and the help provided inside makes it an effective educational tool. This paper highlights the rationale and structure behind the interface, before demonstrating its capabilities in a range of environmental problems. Specifically, we demonstrate the ease at which ResIPy deals with topography, advanced data processing, the ability to fix and constrain regions of known geoelectrical properties, time-lapse analysis and the capability for forward modeling and survey design.},

The primary liner was initially leak tested using an electrical leak location method after the protective drainage soil was placed on the liner. All leaks that were located were repaired. Therefore, the reported leakage was caused by damage to the liner during the placement of the waste material. Because the landfill had up to five meters of waste material covering the liner, a standard electrical leak location survey was not practical. Therefore the newly-developed Electrical Leak Imaging Method (ELIM) was used to locate leaks. Three leaks were located using ELIM. The leaks were repaired and no further leakage has been reported. 1.},

	abstract = {The location of buried utility pipes is often unknown. We use the time-domain induced polarization method to non-intrusively localize metallic pipes. A new approach, based on injecting a primary electrical current between a pair of electrodes and measuring the time-lapse voltage response on a set of potential electrodes after shutting down this primary current is used. The secondary voltage is measured on all the electrodes with respect to a single electrode used as a reference for the electrical potential, in a way similar to a self-potential time lapse survey. This secondary voltage is due to the formation of a secondary current density in the ground associated with the polarization of the metallic pipes. An algorithm is designed to localize the metallic object using the secondary voltage distribution by performing a tomography of the secondary source current density associated with the polarization of the pipes. This algorithm is first benchmarked on a synthetic case. Then, two laboratory sandbox experiments are performed with buried metallic pipes located in a sandbox filled with some clean sand. In Experiment \#1, we use a horizontal copper pipe while in Experiment \#2 we use an inclined stainless steel pipe. The result shows that the method is effective in localizing these two pipes. At the opposite, electrical resistivity tomography is not effective in localizing the pipes because they may appear resistive at low frequencies. This is due to the polarization of the metallic pipes which blocks the charge carriers at its external boundaries.},

	abstract = {During an induced polarization survey, both electrical conductivity and chargeability can be imaged. Recent petrophysical models have been developed to provide a
consistent picture of these two parameters in terms of water and clay contents of soils. We test the ability of this method at a test site in which a controlled artificial
leakage can be generated in an embankment surrounding an experimental basin. 3D tomography of the conductivity and normalized chargeability are performed
during such a controlled leakage. Conductivity and induced polarization measurements were also performed on a core sample from the site. The sample was also
characterized in terms of porosity and cation exchange capacity. Combining the 3D survey and these laboratory measurements, a 3D tomogram of the relative
variation in water content (before leakage and during leakage) was estimated. It clearly exhibits the ground water flow path through the embankment from the outlet
of the tube used to generate the leak to the bottom of the embankment. In addition, a self-potential survey was performed over the zone of leakage. This survey
evidences also the projection of the ground water flow path over the ground surface. Both methods are found to provide a consistent picture. A 2.5D time lapse
tomography of the electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability was also performed and evidences the position of the preferential flow paths below the
profile. These results confirm the ability and efficiency of induced polarization to provide reliable information pertaining to the detection of leakages in dams and
embankments.},

	abstract = {Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub repository directly and package them with the source and binary distributions (e.g., scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and scikit-image (Van der Walt et al., 2014) do this). As data files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the files from a remote server to the user{\rq}s computer. The same problem is faced by scientists using version control to manage their research projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files, keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), Cartopy (Met Office, n.d.), and PyVista (Sullivan \& Kaszynski, 2019) all include code dedicated to this particular task. Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching and maintaining data files.},

@article{perri_time-lapse_2018,
	abstract = {The main goal of this study is to evaluate the reliability of the Mise-{\'a}-la-Masse (MALM) technique associated with saline tracer tests for the characterization of groundwater flow direction and velocity. The experimental site is located in the upper part of the Alento River alluvial plain (Campania Region, Southern Italy). In this paper we present the hydrogeological setting, the experimental setup and the relevant field results. Subsequently, we compare those data against the simulated results obtained with a 3D resistivity model of the test area, coupled with a model describing the Advection -- Dispersion equation for continuous tracer injection. In particular, we calculate a series of 3D forward solutions starting from a reference model, all derived from electrical tomography results, but taking into consideration different values of mean flow velocity and directions. Each electrical resistivity 3D model is used to produce synthetic voltage maps for MALM surveys. Finally, the synthetic MALM voltage maps are compared with the ones measured in the field in order to assess the information content of the MALM dataset with respect to the groundwater field characteristics. The results demonstrate that the information content of the MALM data is sufficient to define important characteristics of the aquifer geometry and properties. This work shows how a combination of three-dimensional time-lapse modeling of flow, tracer transport and electrical current can substantially contribute towards a quantitative interpretation of MALM measurements during a saline tracer test. This approach can thus revive the use of MALM as a practical, low cost field technique for tracer test monitoring and aquifer hydrodynamic characterization.},

	abstract = {A mise-a-la-masse survey was carried out in Bhukia area, Banswara district, Rajasthan, India for auriferous sulfide occurrences. This area was originally surveyed for copper mineralization. Exploratory drilling, however, proved it to be economically not viable. The area was reopened for geophysical surveys when grab samples indicated the presence of gold. Initial geophysical surveys for copper mineralization showed electromagnetic, induced polarization, and resistivity anomalies. At first, one borehole was drilled for gold exploration on the basis of initial geophysical surveys. It encountered massive sulfide mineralization in association with gold. Borehole logging and a mise-a-la-masse survey were carried out in this borehole. Three further boreholes drilled on the basis of the mise-a-la-masse results encountered massive sulfide mineralization in association with gold. One of the three boreholes, 100 m from the first borehole along strike, was used for another set of mise-a-lamasse measurements. A composite equipotential map was prepared using the results of mise-a-la-masse results of both the boreholes. The equipotential contours show a north-northwest--south-southeast trend of mineralization. The boreholes drilled on the basis of the mise-ala-masse results have delineated a strike length of more than 500 m of gold-bearing sulfide mineralization. The sulfide content ranges from 10 to 40\% and gold concentration ranges from 2 to 6 ppm. The dip and plunge of the lode, as anticipated from the mise-a-la-masse results, are toward the west and north, respectively. Mise-a-la-masse surveys are continuing in the adjoining areas.},

@article{soueid_ahmed_sp2dinv_2013,
	abstract = {The self-potential method corresponds to the passive measurement of the electrical field in response to the occurrence of natural sources of current in the ground. One of these sources corresponds to the streaming current associated with the flow of the ground water. We can therefore apply the selfpotential method to recover non-intrusively some information regarding the ground water flow. We first solve the forward problem starting with the solution of the ground water flow problem, then computing the source current density, and finally solving a Poisson equation for the electrical potential. We use the finite-element method to solve the relevant partial differential equations. In order to reduce the number of (petrophysical) model parameters required to solve the forward problem, we introduced an effective charge density tensor of the pore water, which can be determined directly from the permeability tensor for neutral pore waters. The second aspect of our work concerns the inversion of the self-potential data using Tikhonov regularization with smoothness and weighting depth constraints. This approach accounts for the distribution of the electrical resistivity, which can be independently and approximately determined from electrical resistivity tomography. A numerical code, SP2DINV, has been implemented in Matlab to perform both the forward and inverse modeling. Three synthetic case studies are discussed. \& 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{ling_leakage_2019,
	abstract = {Localizing leaks of water and fluids from storage tanks and water reservoirs with geomembranes is an important task for a variety of environmental applications and water resources applications. The minimally intrusive mise-{\`a}-la-masse method is used to detect leaks with the current injected inside the reservoir and a return current electrode located remotely. We test a new approach for the inversion of the voltage data using sandbox experiments and numerical modeling. A method similar to the self-potential inversion method is proposed to inverse the voltages recorded around the tank or reservoir. A global objective function with a data misfit term and regularization term is minimized to invert the voltages. In the inversion process, a depth-weighting matrix is used to strengthen the depth resolution of the current source, and the minimum support method is used to avoid oversmoothed results in terms of leak detection. The distributions of electrical current density on the walls of reservoir indicate the position of leaks. The results show that the inversion method with source compaction accurately identifies the location of single leaks. For two separated leaks, there is an obvious bias for the deeper hole and the bias increases with its depth. For three holes, the source compaction method generally identifies the location of the three leaks when their depth ranges are similar. When one of the leaks becomes deeper, localization of the deeper one becomes more difficult. The influence of the size of the leak on the inversion results is also investigated. The inversion algorithm overestimates the depth of small leaks while it slightly underestimates the depth of large leaks. For a leak having the form of a crack, the inversion results using the source compaction method agree with the position of the leak and its shape.},

The primary liner was initially leak tested using an electrical leak location method after the protective drainage soil was placed on the liner. All leaks that were located were repaired. Therefore, the reported leakage was caused by damage to the liner during the placement of the waste material. Because the landfill had up to five meters of waste material covering the liner, a standard electrical leak location survey was not practical. Therefore the newly-developed Electrical Leak Imaging Method (ELIM) was used to locate leaks. Three leaks were located using ELIM. The leaks were repaired and no further leakage has been reported.},

@article{beasley_threedimensional_1986,
	abstract = {A numerical scheme applying the method of volume integral equations has been developed for borehole‐to‐borehole and borehole‐to‐surface modeling of the apparent resistivity response of a thin conductive body in a half‐space; the inhomogeneity simulates a fracture zone in a geothermal system. The algorithm is applicable for the direct‐current case when the buried electrode is either inside (mise‐{\`a}‐la‐masse) or outside (near‐miss) the body. In implementing the scheme, the integral equation is transformed into a matrix equation as a result of discretizing the inhomogeneity into rectangular cells. All physical properties are assumed constant within each cell. The rectangular cells are used through‐out execution of the algorithm. The computed surface and subsurface apparent resistivity responses are examined for bodies of similar shape and size but with different orientations: (1) vertical, (2) horizontal, (3) dipping at 60 degrees, and (4) dipping at 30 degrees. The four bodies produce apparent resistivity cross‐section plots which differ little from each other except in orientation. Varying the depth to the top of a body does not significantly alter the subsurface apparent resistivity response in the vicinity of the body. In both section and plan views, estimates of orientation, areal extent, and dip can often be made. The maximum depth at which a body can be located and still produce a detectable surface anomaly is dependent upon the position of the buried electrode and upon the contrast in conductivity. Locating the buried electrode just outside the body does not significantly alter the results from those when the electrode is embedded in the inhomogeneity. However, the similarity between the results of these two cases decreases as the distance between the electrode and the body is increased.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT The principle of the mise‐{\'a}‐la‐masse method is to earth one current electrode of a pair in a conducting mineral show (in a borehole, in an outcrop etc.) and measure the resulting distribution of electric potentials. The distribution will, to some extent, reflect the geometry of the ore mass of which the mineral show forms a part. In a mise‐{\'a}‐la‐masse survey of a lead‐zinc deposit in Central Sweden electric potentials were measured on the surface of the ground as well as in some 25 drillholes, in either case with earthings (successively) in three different parts of the irregular ore deposit. Besides this, measurements were made in drillholes with earthings in two further drillholes. Geologic correlation between the drillholes is difficult in the present case on account of the irregular geometry of the ore deposit. However, the mise‐{\'a}‐la‐masse measurements clearly showed the dip and the pitch of the ore body, established connections between the different ore widths encountered in the various holes, and yielded information about the shape of the ore mass. In particular, the survey showed that the ore lenses must be crescent‐shaped rather than tabular, and the dip was indicated to be westerly, instead of easterly as originally presumed. Three‐dimensional models of equipotential surfaces were constructed from the observed drillhole and surface potentials (using transparent plastic sheets and thin copper wire) and these helped to elucidate the mass geometry further. The surface and underground potential data collected in the present case should be of nterest to geophysicists working on analytic continuation problems.},

@article{cella_inversion_2012,
	abstract = {Nonparametric inverse methods provide a general framework for solving potential-field problems. The use of weighted norms leads to a general regularization problem of Tikhonov form. We present an alternative procedure to estimate the source susceptibility distribution from potential field measurements exploiting inversion methods by means of a flexible depth-weighting function in the Tikhonov formulation. Our approach improves the formulation proposed by Li and Oldenburg (1996, 1998), differing significantly in the definition of the depth-weighting function. In our formalism the depth weighting function is associated not to the field decay of a single block (which can be representative of just a part of the source) but to the field decay of the whole source, thus implying that the data inversion is independent on the cell shape. So, in our procedure, the depth-weighting function is not given with a fixed exponent but with the structural index N of the source as the exponent. Differently than previous methods, our choice gives a substantial objectivity to the form of the depth-weighting function and to the consequent solutions. The allowed values for the exponent of the depth-weighting function depend on the range of N for sources: 0 ≤N≤ 3 (magnetic case). The analysis regarding the cases of simple sources such as dipoles, dipole lines, dykes or contacts, validate our hypothesis. The study of a complex synthetic case also proves that the depth-weighting decay cannot be necessarily assumed as equal to 3. Moreover it should not be kept constant for multi-source models but should instead depend on the structural indices of the different sources. In this way we are able to successfully invert the magnetic data of the Vulture area, Southern Italy. An original aspect of the proposed inversion scheme is that it brings an explicit link between two widely used types of interpretation methods, namely those assuming homogeneous fields, such as Euler deconvolution or depth from extreme points transformation and the inversion under the Tikhonov-form including a depth-weighting function. The availability of further constraints, from drillings or known geology, will definitely improve the quality of the solution.},
