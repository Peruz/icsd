Getting Started
===============

.. The getting-started should show some primary use cases in more detail. The reader will follow a step-by-step procedure to set-up a working prototype

ICSD aims to process Mise-Ã -la-masse (MALM) datasets for a variety of applications. 
ICSD has been initially developed for plant root imaging using a python application programming interface.

The simpliest processing can be achieved with the python API::

    from icsd3d import Problem
    k = Problem()
    k.createSurvey('')
    k.invert() # invert measurements
    k.showResults() # display inverted pseudo-section

More examples are available in the Example gallery section.
