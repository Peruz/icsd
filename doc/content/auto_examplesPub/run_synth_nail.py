Multiple sources inversion of CSD
-----------------------------------
The procedure to generate the data is describe in Peruzzo et al. (2020). 
The synthetic test evaluates the iCSD capability to locate a current point source (white dot). 
The white circles represent the VRTe and the white square the return electrode. 
The source of current was centered between four VRTe to highlight the distribution of the current density.
