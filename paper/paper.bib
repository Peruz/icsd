	abstract = {This paper presents a time-lapse application of electrical methods (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT; and mise-{\`a}-la-masse, MALM) for monitoring plant roots and their activity (root water uptake) during a controlled infiltration experiment. The use of non-invasive geophysical monitoring is of increasing interest as these techniques provide time-lapse imaging of processes that otherwise can only be measured at few specific spatial locations. The experiment here described was conducted in a vineyard in Bordeaux (France) and was focused on the behaviour of two neighbouring grapevines. The joint application of ERT and MALM has several advantages. While ERT in time-lapse mode is sensitive to changes in soil electrical resistivity and thus to the factors controlling it (mainly soil water content, in this context), MALM uses DC current injected into a tree stem to image where the plant root system is in effective electrical contact with the soil at locations that are likely to be the same where root water uptake (RWU) takes place. Thus, ERT and MALM provide complementary information about the root structure and activity. The experiment shows that the region of likely electrical current sources produced by MALM does not change significantly during the infiltration time in spite of the strong changes of electrical resistivity caused by changes in soil water content. Ultimately, the interpretation of the current source distribution strengthened the hypothesis of using current as a proxy for root detection. This fact, together with the evidence that current injection in the soil and in the stem produces totally different voltage patterns, corroborates the idea that this application of MALM highlights the active root density in the soil. When considering the electrical resistivity changes (as measured by ERT) inside the stationary volume of active roots delineated by MALM, the overall tendency is towards a resistivity increase during irrigation time, which can be linked to a decrease in soil water content caused by root water uptake. On the contrary, when considering the soil volume outside the MALM-derived root water uptake region, the electrical resistivity tends to decrease as an effect of soil water content increase caused by the infiltration. The use of a simplified infiltration model confirms at least qualitatively this behaviour. The monitoring results are particularly promising, and the method can be applied to a variety of scales including the laboratory scale where direct evidence of root structure and root water uptake can help corroborate the approach. Once fully validated, the joint use of MALM and ERT can be used as a valuable tool to study the activity of roots under a wide variety of field conditions.},

@article{mary_small-scale_2018,
	abstract = {The investigation of plant roots is inherently difficult and often neglected. Being out of sight, roots are often out of mind. Nevertheless, roots play a key role in the exchange of mass and energy between soil and the atmosphere, in addition to the many practical applications in agriculture. In this paper, we propose a method for roots imaging based on the joint use of two electrical noninvasive methods: electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and mise-{\`a}-la-masse (MALM). The approach is based on the key assumption that the plant root system acts as an electrically conductive body, so that injecting electrical current into the plant stem will ultimately result in the injection of current into the subsoil through the root system, and particularly through the root terminations via hair roots. Evidence from field data, showing that voltage distribution is very different whether current is injected into the tree stem or in the ground, strongly supports this hypothesis. The proposed procedure involves a stepwise inversion of both ERT and MALM data that ultimately leads to the identification of electrical resistivity (ER) distribution and of the current injection root distribution in the threedimensional soil space. This, in turn, is a proxy to the active (hair) root density in the ground. We tested the proposed procedure on synthetic data and, more importantly, on field data collected in a vineyard, where the estimated depth of the root zone proved to be in agreement with literature on similar crops. The proposed noninvasive approach is a step forward towards a better quantification of root structure and functioning.},

	abstract = {The work in this paper is motivated by the increasing use of electrical and electromagnetic methods in geoscience problems where steel-cased wells are present. Applications of interest include monitoring carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. Also of interest is detecting flaws or breaks in degrading steel-casings---such wells pose serious environmental hazards. The general principles of electrical methods with steel-cased wells are understood and several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel-cased wells can be beneficial for detecting signal due to targets at depth. However, the success of a direct current (DC) resistivity survey lies in the details. Secondary signals might only be a few per cent of the primary signal. In designing a survey, the geometry of the source and receivers, and whether the source is at the top of the casing, inside of it, or beneath the casing will impact measured responses. Also the physical properties and geometry of the background geology, target and casing will have a large impact on the measured data. Because of the small values of the diagnostic signals, it is important to understand the detailed physics of the problem and also to be able to carry out accurate simulations. This latter task is computationally challenging because of the extreme geometry of the wells, which extend kilometers in depth but have millimeter variations in the radial direction, and the extreme variation in the electrical conductivity which is typically 5--7 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background geology.},

High potential gradients then reveal likely location of leak spots within the liner. The approach is very expensive and is clearly not applicable in existing sites, where retrofitting is not an option.

Although field surveys using these methods are relatively straightforward, ERT and IP data require the application of inverse methods prior to any interpretation. Several established non-commercial inversion codes exist, but they typically require advanced knowledge to use effectively. ResIPy was developed to provide a more intuitive, user-friendly, approach to inversion of geoelectrical data, using an open source graphical user interface (GUI) and a Python application programming interface (API). ResIPy utilizes the mature R2/cR2 inversion codes for ERT and IP, respectively. The ResIPy GUI facilitates data importing, data filtering, error modeling, mesh generation, data inversion and plotting of inverse models. Furthermore, the easy to use design of ResIPy and the help provided inside makes it an effective educational tool. This paper highlights the rationale and structure behind the interface, before demonstrating its capabilities in a range of environmental problems. Specifically, we demonstrate the ease at which ResIPy deals with topography, advanced data processing, the ability to fix and constrain regions of known geoelectrical properties, time-lapse analysis and the capability for forward modeling and survey design.},

The primary liner was initially leak tested using an electrical leak location method after the protective drainage soil was placed on the liner. All leaks that were located were repaired. Therefore, the reported leakage was caused by damage to the liner during the placement of the waste material. Because the landfill had up to five meters of waste material covering the liner, a standard electrical leak location survey was not practical. Therefore the newly-developed Electrical Leak Imaging Method (ELIM) was used to locate leaks. Three leaks were located using ELIM. The leaks were repaired and no further leakage has been reported. 1.},

A new approach, based on injecting a primary electrical current between a pair of electrodes and measuring the time-lapse voltage response on a set of potential electrodes after shutting down this primary current is used. The secondary voltage is measured on all the electrodes with respect to a single electrode used as a reference for the electrical potential, in a way similar to a self-potential time lapse survey. This secondary voltage is due to the formation of a secondary current density in the ground associated with the polarization of the metallic pipes. An algorithm is designed to localize the metallic object using the secondary voltage distribution by performing a tomography of the secondary source current density associated with the polarization of the pipes. This algorithm is first benchmarked on a synthetic case. Then, two laboratory sandbox experiments are performed with buried metallic pipes located in a sandbox filled with some clean sand. In Experiment \#1, we use a horizontal copper pipe while in Experiment \#2 we use an inclined stainless steel pipe. The result shows that the method is effective in localizing these two pipes. At the opposite, electrical resistivity tomography is not effective in localizing the pipes because they may appear resistive at low frequencies. This is due to the polarization of the metallic pipes which blocks the charge carriers at its external boundaries.},

consistent picture of these two parameters in terms of water and clay contents of soils. We test the ability of this method at a test site in which a controlled artificial
leakage can be generated in an embankment surrounding an experimental basin. 3D tomography of the conductivity and normalized chargeability are performed
during such a controlled leakage. Conductivity and induced polarization measurements were also performed on a core sample from the site. The sample was also
characterized in terms of porosity and cation exchange capacity. Combining the 3D survey and these laboratory measurements, a 3D tomogram of the relative
variation in water content (before leakage and during leakage) was estimated. It clearly exhibits the ground water flow path through the embankment from the outlet
of the tube used to generate the leak to the bottom of the embankment. In addition, a self-potential survey was performed over the zone of leakage. This survey
evidences also the projection of the ground water flow path over the ground surface. Both methods are found to provide a consistent picture. A 2.5D time lapse
tomography of the electrical conductivity and normalized chargeability was also performed and evidences the position of the preferential flow paths below the

	abstract = {Scientific software is usually created to acquire, analyze, model, and visualize data. As such, many software libraries include sample datasets in their distributions for use in documentation, tests, benchmarks, and workshops. A common approach is to include smaller datasets in the GitHub repository directly and package them with the source and binary distributions (e.g., scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) and scikit-image (Van der Walt et al., 2014) do this). As data files increase in size, it becomes unfeasible to store them in GitHub repositories. Thus, larger datasets require writing code to download the files from a remote server to the user{\rq}s computer. The same problem is faced by scientists using version control to manage their research projects. While downloading a data file over HTTPS can be done easily with modern Python libraries, it is not trivial to manage a set of files, keep them updated, and check for corruption. For example, scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), Cartopy (Met Office, n.d.), and PyVista (Sullivan \& Kaszynski, 2019) all include code dedicated to this particular task. Instead of scientists and library authors recreating the same code, it would be best to have a minimalistic and easy to set up tool for fetching and maintaining data files.},
